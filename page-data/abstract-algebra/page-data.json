In this very first post, we will introduce the basic concepts in group theory, starting from mappings, equivalent relations, partitions, and extending to groups and homomorphisms. We will also encounter the first important theorem, the Lagrange's theorem."},"excerpt":"This is the first post of the Introduction to Abstract Algebra series.
