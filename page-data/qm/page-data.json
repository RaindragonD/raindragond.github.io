In the first post, we introduce the Stern-Gerlach experiment, which leads to the discovery of spin, a fundamental quantum mechanical nature of elementary particles. We then lay out the postulates of the QM. Finally, we introduce the Dirac notation, the mathematical notation we used in QM."},"excerpt":"This is the first post of the Introduction to Quantum Mechanics series.

In the post, we focus on yet another translation, not in space, but in time. From time-evolution of quantum mechanical states, we will meet the Schrödinger equation and the Hamiltonian, the operator corresponding to the total energy of the system."},"excerpt":"In the last post, we deal with the rotations in quantum mechanics.
